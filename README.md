# mutation-game
An application that simulates real world genetic evolution of organisms

Inspired by Charles Dawkin's Book, "The Greatest Show on Earth" the mutation-game was a project that I developed to demonstrate evolution at a small scale yet substantially
covering the key concepts of adaptation, meiosis, mutation and natural selection.
